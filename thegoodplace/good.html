								<h2>Chidi Anagonye</h2>
				    	<p>He was a Professor of Moral Philosophy and worked in several countries. His overwhelming knowledge of ethics often caused him to obsess over whether even his most insignificant actions were ethical, such as telling his friend he liked his boots when in fact he hated them. Even in the afterlife, he taught Ethics to his neighbors to help them better themselves.</p>

						<h2>Eleanor Shellstrop</h2>
				    <p>Eleanor was a self-described “Arizona dirtbag” during her time on Earth, having been born in Phoenix, attended college in Tempe, and then moved back to Phoenix. She dedicated her afterlife to  learning Ethics and becoming a better person. While she initially did this solely for self-preservation, she begins to gradually become more selfless and thoughtful as time goes by.</p>

						<h2>Tahani Al-Jamil</h2>
				    <p>In both her life and afterlife she is regarded as highly intelligent, a brilliant conversationalist, and a wonderful hostess. She is exceptionally attractive and very fashionable. Although her acts on Earth seemed selfless, she had to fight against her narcissistic tendencies to achieve true happiness and selflessness in the afterlife.</p>

					<h2>Jason Mendoza</h2>
					<p>In life, Jason was often considered dumb, and was a misguided man who had major impulse issues. While not a violent person, he believed every problem could be solved by throwing a Molotov because throwing the molotov replace any previous problems with a new problem. With Chidi’s help, he begins to gain control of his impulses and starts acting thoughtfully in the afterlife.</p>

				<h2>Michael</h2>
				<p>Michael is first introduced as the architect that constructed the Good Place neighborhood that Eleanor, Chidi, Jason, and Tahani reside in. Although his true identity is revealed to be a an undying demon, he turns his devious ways around with the help of Chidi, Eleanor, Tahani and Jason, and is able to truly call himself “good.”</p>

			<h2>Janet</h2>
			<p>You already met Janet, but here’s a formal introduction. Janet is neither a human nor an Eternal Being, but rather an anthropomorphized vessel of knowledge. Furthermore, she is not a robot, nor is she a girl, and she politely points these out whenever anyone mistakes her for being either one. However, Janet uses she/her pronouns. Also, she’s not really your neighbor, but more like your best friend who knows literally everything.</p>
